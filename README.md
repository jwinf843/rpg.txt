A framework for building a text-based RPG in Python3

I will be using this repository as a skeleton to build a text-based RPG Engine in Python. 
The engine should do several things: 
  - Generate a Map
  - Generate a player with stats and location variable
  - Generate locations and save them to a map
  - Generate quests for the player to accomplish
  - Generate monsters and NPCs on the map
  - Allow for the player to interact with the world and its inhabitants
